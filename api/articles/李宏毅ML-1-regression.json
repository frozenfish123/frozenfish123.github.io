Then we use some new data as input, we can get unknown output that the known data can predict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>Q：What is a model? Why do we need a model? How do we find a model?<br>In this context, model is the best function of the original set of functions.</li>\n<li>Q：What is Gradient Descend？（☆）<br>We use this method to find an optimal answer. When gradient goes to zero, the value of the function goes to minimal. In our context, we use the loss function to evalueate how effective our model function(or regression function) is. We need to find the minimal of the loss function, as well as the pixel of the minimal point, for the number of pixel shows the best model function.</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n","categories":[],"tags":[]}
